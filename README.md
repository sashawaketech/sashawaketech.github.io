# About Me

## My Interests 

My biggest joy is spending time with my daughterâ€”she just turned 2 and brings so much happiness and energy into my life.

I also have two pets, **a friendly Welsh Corgi** and **a curious cat**, who are very much part of the family.

In my free time, I love to read. I usually finish ~ _70 _books_ a year. I enjoy both fiction and non-fiction, especially stories that make me think.

These interests keep me happy, curious, and balanced in everyday life.
